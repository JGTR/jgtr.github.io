    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com">Sinatra</a> is a framework built on Ruby to create web applications.</p>

<p>In this post I want to outline how the codebase of a Sinatra application is organized, given that I will start building on Sinatra soon.</p>

<h3>The Setup</h3>

<p>First I have to find an interesting Sinatra app to analyze. There are several websites where lists of Sinatra apps can be browsed. I used the following sources:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/wild.html">Sinatra website</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/oren/sinatra-examples">Oren&rsquo;s Github Sinatra-examples repository</a></li>
<li><a href="http://shopify.github.io/dashing/">Sinatra Dashboard App called Dashing</a></li>
</ul>


<p>I chose to focus on Dashing because it may prove useful on an app that my <a href="flatironschool.com">Flatiron School</a> team is working to build. (More on that later!)</p>

<p>The instructions for setting up the app are relatively stratight-forward.</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">gem</span> <span class="n">install</span> <span class="n">dashing</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">dashing</span> <span class="kp">new</span> <span class="n">sweet_dashboard_project</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">bundle</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">dashing</span> <span class="n">start</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>With just these few lines on the command-line, the rack server gets going and shows a pretty &ldquo;dashing&rdquo; dashboard landing page.</p>

<p>I then decided to post this to Heroku so it would be visible beyond my own localhost. To do this, I need to:</p>

<ol>
<li>install the Heroku gem</li>
<li>make my &ldquo;sweet_dashboard_project&rdquo; a git repo</li>
<li>create a Heroku app</li>
<li>push the code to Heroku for deployment.</li>
</ol>


<p>All this is surprisingly easy, and only requires the following commands:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">gem</span> <span class="n">install</span> <span class="n">heroku</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">git</span> <span class="n">init</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">git</span> <span class="n">add</span> <span class="o">.</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">git</span> <span class="n">commit</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">am</span> <span class="s2">&quot;first commit&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">heroku</span> <span class="n">create</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">git</span> <span class="n">push</span> <span class="n">heroku</span> <span class="n">master</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now you can visit the resulting Dashing app here: <a href="http://secret-garden-3665.herokuapp.com/sample">Sample app</a></p>

<h3>The codebase organization for Dashing</h3>

<p>The codebase is organized into the following folders:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>assets</strong> : includes sub-folders for fongs, images, javascript and stylesheets</li>
<li><strong>dashboards</strong> : has the ERB files that render into HTML</li>
<li><strong>jobs</strong> : has 4 ruby files that actually have the logic of the app &mdash; the ERB files from dashboard make ruby commands that access this code</li>
<li><strong>lib</strong> empty directory; in other Sinatra apps, the lib</li>
<li><strong>public</strong> contains the 404 error page and the favicon</li>
<li><strong>widgets</strong> the other meaty folder besides the jobs; contains coffeescript, html and scss files for the dashboard widgets which are rendered into the layouts in the dashboards ERB files</li>
</ul>


<p>The other file of note is the config.ru in the root directory; this initializes the rack app.</p>

<p>So basically, the <strong>views</strong> are in the dashboards, and this pulls logic from the jobs folder (<strong>controller of sorts</strong>), and draws formatting/browser behavior from the widgets folder.</p>

<p>One notable missing element from this webapp is any need for a database / models. This is something which is necessary for most webapps and which I will have to incorporate into my Sinatra app to mold it to my purposes. More about that later!</p>

    <link href="http://jgtr.github.io/blog/2013/06/16/immutability-in-ruby-applications/"/>
    <updated>2013-06-16T21:48:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://jgtr.github.io/blog/2013/06/16/immutability-in-ruby-applications</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Looking through the programming presentations on <a href="www.speakerdeck.com">Speakerdeck</a> I found one created recently by Michael Fairley entitled <a href="http://speakerdeck.com/michaelfairley/immutable-ruby">Immutable Ruby</a>.</p>

<p>Michael suggests a technique to ensure that information in an application which is thought of as unchangeable actually stays this way. There are plenty of transformations that can corrupt data, and so I agree that it is probably a good idea to be clear about what should be out of scope for manipulation.</p>

<p>To this end, I will reproduce a few techniques that Michael Fairley puts forward in his presentation. The deck is actually quite long and covers a bunch of other interesting topics (such as: deep freeze with ice nine, and event sourcing), so for more depth please visit his presentation.</p>

<h3>Creating an immutable module</h3>

<p>Lets suppose you are running an online store where you have a purchases table that records previous purchases.The table might look like this:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Purchase</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="ss">ActiveRecord</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="ss">:Base</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="c1"># t.integer :user_id</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="c1"># t.integer :price</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="c1"># t.integer :item_id</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>There would be little reason to change this data, so it seems likely you would want to make it immutable to protect its integrity. Thus, it would be helpful to have an immutable module, like so:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Purchase</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="ss">ActiveRecord</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="ss">:Base</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="kp">include</span> <span class="no">Immutable</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>To make an immutable module, only 5 lines of code are needed, as follows:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="no">Module</span> <span class="no">Immutable</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">readonly?</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">persisted?</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now, if we try to update data on the purchases table, the change does not go through:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">purchase</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">update_attributes</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">.</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">#=&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="ss">ActiveRecord</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="ss">:ReadOnlyRecord</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Harnessing active_record with the immutable_attributes gem</h3>

<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be great to control mutability on certain fields? The immutable_attributes gem allows this:
<a href="http://github.com/JackDanger/immutable_attributes">github.com/JackDanger/immutable_attributes</a>
<strong><em> gem install immutable_attributes </em></strong></p>

<p>Now we can harness ActiveRecord to make the fields on the purchase table immutable, as follows:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Purchase</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="ss">ActiveRecord</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="ss">:Base</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">attr_immutable</span> <span class="ss">:user_id</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">attr_immutable</span> <span class="ss">:price</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">attr_immutable</span> <span class="ss">:item_id</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Using the freeze method</h3>

<h4>The problem</h4>

<p>We might start with a method that will build a full url for a part of the application based on some params. This may look as follows:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">build_url</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">base</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">path</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">params</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">{})</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">base</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;/&quot;</span> <span class="k">unless</span> <span class="n">path</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">start_with?</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;/&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">base</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="n">path</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">base</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;?&quot;</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">params</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">to_param</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">params</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">present?</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">base</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="no">ROOT_URL</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;http://example.com&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">example_url</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">path</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">params</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{})</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">build_url</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="no">ROOT_URL</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">path</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">params</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Although this code may look like it works, in actuality it may generate some problems as follows:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">example_url</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;blog&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">#=&gt; &quot;http://example.url/blog&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">example_url</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;/photos&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:sort</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;size&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">#=&gt; &quot;http://example.url/blog/photos?sort=size&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">example_url</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;/photos&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:sort</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;size&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">#=&gt; &quot;http://example.url/blog/photos?sort=size/photos?sort=size&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>What is going on here? There is only one instance of the ROOT_URL being created, which is then passed into the build_url method over and over. In the build_url, the <strong>shovel operators (&lt;&lt;) are mutating this single instance of the string</strong>.</p>

<h4>Fixes</h4>

<p>One simple way to fix this would be to replace the &ldquo;&lt;&lt;&rdquo; with =+ in the code.</p>

<p>A better way would be to use a freeze method on the ROOT_URL, forcing the application to raise an exception if the string would be mutated. this would look like this:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="no">ROOT_URL</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;http://example.com&quot;</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">freeze</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

    <updated>2013-06-11T15:18:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://jgtr.github.io/blog/2013/06/11/sandi-metz-at-the-flatiron-school</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://sandimetz.com/">Sandi Metz</a> came to the <a href="http://flatironschool.com">Flatiron School</a> on Tuesday, June 11, 2013.
We were privileged to hear her talk with the group and answer questions very candidly. She spoke from 32 years of experience as a programmer. She was earnest and encouraging and left the class with much to admire and think about. The following are <em>just a few</em> of the topics she touched upon.</p>

<h3>How Sandi got started as a programmer</h3>

<p>Sandi Metz started by going to technical school. She considered architecture but was pointed in the direction of &ldquo;data processing&rdquo; which meant &ldquo;computer programming&rdquo;. It was 1979 and a friend told her &ldquo;I think you might be good at data processing&rdquo;. She decided to try it, finding herself late at night programming fortran  on punch cards. She was 19 at the time.</p>

<h3>She was one of the first Rails users</h3>

<h4>What made Rails special</h4>

<p>Before frameworks like Rails, programmers would write massive XML files that would tell the application how to interact with the database. This is a nightmare to maintain and is a problem Rails solved. Rails uses ActiveRecord, which allows the application to intuitively interact with the data structure based on the class specifications. This makes Rails more intuitive and easier to work with. ActiveRecord made Rails stand-out for Sandi in 2006, even though it was an unproven framework.</p>

<h4>History</h4>

<p>At the time, Sandi worked for Duke University, Sandi decided to try rails because she wanted a dynamic language that was object-oriented. She heard Dave Thomas speak and decided to switch her mission-critical application from java to Ruby on Rails. She had no deployment plan and was saved by Zed Shaw&rsquo;s release of Mongrel &mdash; the first web server for Ruby web applications. Sandi spoke about how Zed Shaw stayed up all night to help her resolve a problem in production to meet her deadline. (It was an https bug!) She says, <em>&ldquo;He gave me the shirt of his back in a time when I was desperate, and I will never forget it.&rdquo;</em></p>

<h3>Technology trends to watch for</h3>

<p>She spoke briefly about two trends in programming that she is very excited about:
1. Multiple-processing: This seems to be happening in functional languages, like pascal. It is something that she is curious to see if it will be implemented somehow in Rails.
2. Micro-service architectures. This refers to a shift from writing large, separate and entirely unrelated applications, to writing small applications with the ability to communicate with each other. These would be in the cloud.</p>

<h3>Embracing fear</h3>

<p>Sandi was extremely humble and open in her demeanor. She encouraged everyone in the class to not take failure as a moral failure, but simply as a call to action to keep practicing and keep learning. She disclosed the areas where she still wants to improve, and advocated always feeling slightly stretched to keep learning and growing. She said, <em>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about being afraid. Don&rsquo;t feel like you are not good because you are afraid. Fear is a motivating thing. Embrace it.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>She referenced and recommended the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/books/dp/1455509124">So Good They Can&rsquo;t Ignore You</a>. She mentioned the concept of &ldquo;deliberate practice&rdquo;, and not being afraid to fail. The key is to practice what you are uncomfortable with.</p>

<h3>My personal reflection</h3>

<p>Sandi is an inspiring down-to-earth figure. I think that the young generations are not frequently well-informed about the history of the industry. Having Sandi recount the experience living through these changes is definitely valuable both practically and from a human perspective. Anyone who develops skill in any field will at some point need to take responsibility for trying to give back to the community and trying to shape it for the better &mdash; Sandi sets a great example.</p>

    <link href="http://jgtr.github.io/blog/2013/06/11/reflections-after-7-days-of-coding/"/>
    <updated>2013-06-11T14:59:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://jgtr.github.io/blog/2013/06/11/reflections-after-7-days-of-coding</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As a newcomer to the field of coding, I&rsquo;ve had several gut reactions:</p>

<h3>1) Coding feels human</h3>

<p>Non-coders frequently think of coding (as other technical disciplines) as far removed from other creative, artistic or expressive fields. We imagine dark rooms filled with the buzzing of servers.</p>

<p>My immersion in it has proven the contrary: building anything is a fulfilling experience because it gives the architect the experience of going from nothing to something &mdash; it requires imagination.</p>

<p>Debugging is like writing and struggling to find the right word.</p>

<h3>2) There is magic in the code &mdash; really</h3>

<p>As a child, I would wonder about the concept of magic. I thought it was a cool idea, but could never feel comfortable with the notion of &ldquo;abracadabra&rdquo; &mdash; that some specific words or gestures would do something inexplicable. These words or gestures themselves have no further atomizable operations and that just never make sense. Coding bridges this gap.</p>

<p>Coding shows the methods behind the curtain operating the smokes and mirrors. Constructing an application that works also has the feel of wizardry. Methods and techniques are modern-day spells. They are the basis by which we weave more complex magic. Thus it is true that any sufficiently advanced technology appears to be magic.</p>

<h3>3) Impact is inevitable</h3>

<p>Philosophy has tried to understand what are the most general truths we may know. Some critics say that philosophy has been ineffective because words are too fuzzy to allow for meaningful conclusions that have impact. For more, see: <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/philosophy.html#f15n">Paul Graham&rsquo;s essay &lsquo;How to do Philosophy&rsquo;</a></p>

<p>Coding is a relatively new discipline by which simple logic can affect the world &mdash; not by analyzing it to death, but by providing new capabilities and creations that cannot but affect the world around us.</p>

<p>Taking in sum, the human intellect cannot but continue to express itself into reality. In this encounter with it, we all benefit. Truth becomes apparent through creation. We know what is true, because we create it. And we can only create that which was always already true.</p>
